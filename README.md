🚀 Project Update: GDP Analysis Using SQL & Power BI 📊
Excited to share my latest data analysis project, where I leveraged SQL and Power BI to uncover valuable insights on GDP and employment trends across various cities. 🏙️
🔍 Here's what I achieved: 

1️⃣ Cleaned and analyzed the data using advanced SQL queries to ensure accuracy and eliminate null values. 

2️⃣ Calculated the Average Unemployment Rate for 2022 across cities.

3️⃣ Identified the Top 5 Cities with the highest growth in patents per million inhabitants between two years. 

4️⃣ Compared Unemployment Rates with Youth Unemployment across multiple years. 

5️⃣ Retrieved cities with R&D Expenditure above a set threshold. 

6️⃣ Highlighted cities where the ICT Sector employs more than 10% of the workforce. 

7️⃣ Determined each sector’s contribution to the total GDP for cities. 

8️⃣ Found cities with the largest SME Employment growth between two years. 

9️⃣ Analyzed the correlation between R&D Expenditure and GDP Growth. 

🔟 Correlated GDP Growth with Unemployment Rates.

📊 Created an insightful dashboard using Power BI to visualize all these trends and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
